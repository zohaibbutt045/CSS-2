// Main Note
// Only a single item can also be a grid container and then , text inside the element will become grid element 
// it is used in header.scss

// it is best to display images as block

// implicit rows are created as min-content by default


// Notes

Units :-
// Always try to use responsive units
// 1fr means a max space it can occupy -- if there is no space to occupy -- then it will be hidden --
// thats y we use minmax function with it too

grids :-
// Explicit grids are those -- we have defined already for rows and columns -- so we deal with them normally
// Implicit grids are those -- that does not fit in a space we have specified for them -- so they occupy their own space in rows or columns-- so we deal with them in a different way


grid properties :-
// min-content -- grid size will be size of  -- according to its content 
// max-content -- content size will try to fix in a smallest possible grid
// minmax() -- so grids will be in the limit we give to this function
//auto-fit is for responsive

// grid-row: 3 / span 2 . means start from line 3 and cover 2 lines forward -- same for cols
// grid gap does not add spacing on the start or rows/cols and on the ends


// Lining :-
// in 2 cols or in 2 rows -- we have 3 lines - 1 2 3 .. one on the start of 1st block - second on the end of 1st block and on the start of 2nd block and 3rd on the end of 2nd block ..
// in 3 rows or in  cols -- 4 lines . and vice versa
// we have line numbers like 1 - end of 1 (2) - start of 2 (2) - end of 2 (3) - start of 3 (3) -- as it is 


// Naming :- 
 -- I have a lecture on that -- i can see that if i don't remember..

// spanning :-
1 2 3 will indicate line numbers ..
span 2 means -- to extend to next 2 lines ..
-1 can only be used with explicit grids 

Usage of cols L
// most of the times -- we only create columns .. and rows are created automatically 
// and we can use them

New Property for image for grids :-
// object-fit property ..
// images have their own aspect ratio -- so they don't cover all the space in grids or some other places
// we need to cover the img element with some container like figure ..
// and then , apply object fit property 
// this property will only work if we have manually initialized height and width
